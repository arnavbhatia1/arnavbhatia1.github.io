# Arnav Bhatia - Personal Portfolio

My personal website showcasing my work as a software engineer, built with modern web technologies.

**Live Site:** [arnavbhatia1.github.io](https://arnavbhatia1.github.io)

## About This Project

This is my digital space where I share my professional journey, technical projects, and approach to engineering. I built this site to serve as both a portfolio and a window into how I think about building systems that bridge technical complexity with business impact.

- **Projects Showcase**: Work and personal projects, including ML pipelines, API gateways, and AI-powered applications
- **Open Source Contributions**: Public repositories and side projects I'm actively working on
- **Contact Form**: Easy ways to reach me for opportunities, collaborations, or just to chat about engineering

### Built With
